# Group-5-Scooters

## Solution to the challenge statement.
We will create a program that allows either customers or employees to create accounts as part of a scooter rental company. Customers will be able to create accounts and make rentals from the list of available scooters. Employees can view the list of scooters and rentals and approve pending rentals for customers. Administrators will have the same permissions as employees but will be able to manage employee accounts as well. Our program will store and organize all of the information pertaining to scooter availability, location, and pricing in a separate file that is accessible by several users at the same time. There will be protections in place to ensure that user passwords are protected and that data isnâ€™t being read from our database while another instance of the program is in the process of writing to that file
